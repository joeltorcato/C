# 📌 c study  
this repository contains all the code i developed throughout my **c** language learning journey. over more than a year, i practiced fundamental concepts, solved exercises, and created small projects to consolidate my knowledge.  

## 📂 content  
here you'll find a variety of code, including:  
✅ control structures (if, loops, switch)  
✅ array and string manipulation  
✅ functions and recursion  
✅ pointers and dynamic memory allocation  
✅ structures and file manipulation  
✅ practical projects  

## 🚀 purpose  
the goal of this repository is to serve as an archive of my study and, at the same time, help those who are also learning **c**.  

now, i'm starting my journey in **java**, but this repository will remain available for reference!  

## 📎 how to use  
to compile and run the code, simply use a **c** compiler, like gcc:  
```sh
gcc filename.c -o executablename
./executablename
```
